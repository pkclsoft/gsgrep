grep [-aHhinR] pattern [file ...]

-a  Treat all files as ASCII text.  Use of this option forces gsgrep to
    output lines matching the specified pattern.
        
-i  Perform case insensitive matching.  By default, grep is case sensitive.

-H  Always print filename headers with output lines.

-h  Never print filename headers (i.e. filenames) with output lines.

-n  Each output line is preceded by its relative line number in the file,
    starting at line 1.  The line number counter is reset for each file processed.

-R  Recursively search subdirectories listed.
